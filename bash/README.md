# Bash

In most of these files, the best explanation will be in the comments.

This README is a high level overview of each file.

## init

### .bash_aliases 

Contains useful aliases, included by the .bashrc file.

See inline comments for a description of each alias.

### .bash_functions

Another file included by .bashrc, but this one contains functions instead of aliases.

### .bashrc

This is based on a default .bashrc file found in a Linux system that I liked.

Slightly modified by me.


## utils

### .bash_examples  

This file contains bash commands which are useful utilities but which aren't as easily made into an alias or function.

### CodeToHTML.sh  

Scrape the text of all .c and .h source files and pass it to a website to turn it into a nice highlighted PDF.

### calculate.sh

Examples of using the arbitrary precision calculator.


## etc
